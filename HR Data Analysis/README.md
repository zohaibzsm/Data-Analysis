# **HR Analysis using Power BI**

Software: `MS Power BI`  
Database: `MS Excel`  
Programming Language: `DAX`  
  
In this project, I built a dashboard that can be useful for HR person in managing people. The dashboard contains Percentage(%) of People Presence overall time span(the data is given), WorkFromHome, and Sick Leave. 
<br><br>The dashboard answers some of the following questions:
<br>Which day most People are `Present`? (maybe if any specific event occurs.)
<br>What are the priorities in `WorkingFromOffice` and `WorkingFromHome` on a given day or any time span?
<br>What is the `WorkFromHome` and `SickLeave` (%)?

The final output is:
